# Week 6

For this activity you will implement the linear and binary searches you used to complete the Search Tabular Trace Activity. There is a test class (TestSearchMethods.java) on Blackboard that you will use to test your search methods. When you are successful, your output will look similar to the output below. Your format may differ; however, your trace and number of comparisons must be the same.

Rather than implement the recursive version of binary search shown on page 171 of your textbook, implement an iterative version. That means you will need to use a while loop.

For this activity, you may work in pairs.
