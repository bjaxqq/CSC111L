# CSC111L

### Course Description

Students gain experience in data structures programming by completing a series of activities, which increase in complexity, covering a range of topics from the CSC 111 course. This course is taken in conjunction with [CSC 111](https://github.com/bjaxqq/GDD140).

### Tools and Languages Used

This course moved away from Scala and started to use Java to explore more complex topics of object-oriented programming. Coding was done in Visual Studio Code.
